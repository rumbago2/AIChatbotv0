# This is an Anvil Server Module.
#
# In this project, all backend logic (LLM calls, database access)
# is handled by the Google Colab notebook via the Anvil Uplink.
#
# Therefore, this file is not used and can remain empty.
# You could add functions here if you needed to perform actions
# on Anvil's servers, like accessing Anvil's own Data Tables.

# @anvil.server.callable
# def a_function_on_anvils_server():
#   print("This function runs on Anvil's servers, not Colab.")
#   return "Hello from Anvil's server!"
